# Things with WoW Cata Classic

1. Leveling 1 through 10,[^1] feels brainless and **drains me mentally**. Happy that WoW Remix is going to be a thing so that I don't have to do this so many times over, especially since I want to try out so many different classes. [^bignote]

2. Ability learning feels slow. Stuck on a very specific damage spell with an occasional upgrade here and there, genuinely happy with choosing Druid since I feel I get more mileage out of it gaining skills for bear and cat form; however it is hardly the case for any other class

3. Evokers, Monks and to a degree Death Knights not being available is a bit of a flacid dick moment, less plates to choose from

4. What the fuck are professions? what the fuck is battlegrounds? what the fuck is half of the things i can do rn? (lack of tutorials, and yes its ironic a dota player says this but even Dota has one, I don't mind watching a good video on it but *really?* Zero built-in tutorials? Come on.)

My personal Exodia change would be that after reaching Lv 55 you unlock Death Knights, Monks, Evokers and the alternate leveling path: A faster way to Lv15 than the normal way. Doesn't have to be 2500% faster, just at least 100% faster. This would make me feel more whole with options and things to mess around with, make me want to commit to reach a high Lv AND make me want to make more characters, basically rewarding me for spending time in the game.

[^1]: if not through 15.

[^bignote]: Honestly it has been better with friends; specifically the first levelling experience where we leveled Trolls with Cameron or I leveled Tauren with Young, company made it bearable. It shouldn't be this way in my opinion for second characters since you already have the hang of it, there should be a faster leveling alternative for a second character if you have a Lv 30 character in the realm or something like that.
