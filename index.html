<ol>
<li>Leveling 1 through 10,[^1] feels brainless and <strong>drains me mentally</strong>. Happy that WoW Remix is going to be a thing so that I don&#39;t have to do this so many times over, especially since I want to try out so many different classes. [^bignote]</li>
</ol>
<p>[^1]: if not through 15.</p>
<p>[^bignote]: Honestly it has been better with friends; specifically the first levelling experience where we leveled Trolls with Cameron or I leveled Tauren with Young, company made it bearable. It shouldn&#39;t be this way in my opinion for second characters since you already have the hang of it, there should be a faster leveling alternative for a second character if you have a Lv 30 character in the realm or something like that. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ability learning feels slow. Stuck on a very specific damage spell with an occasional upgrade here and there, genuinely happy with choosing Druid since I feel I get more mileage out of it gaining skills for bear and cat form; however it is hardly the case for any other class</p>
</li>
<li><p>Evokers, Monks and to a degree Death Knights not being available is a bit of a flacid dick moment, less plates to choose from</p>
</li>
<li><p>What the fuck are professions? what the fuck is battlegrounds? what the fuck is half of the things i can do rn? (lack of tutorials, and yes its ironic a dota player says this but even Dota has one, I don&#39;t mind watching a good video on it but <em>really?</em> Zero built-in tutorials? Come on.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>My personal Exodia change would be that after reaching Lv 55 you unlock Death Knights, Monks, Evokers and the alternate leveling path: A faster way to Lv15 than the normal way. Doesn&#39;t have to be 2500% faster, just at least 100% faster. This would make me feel more whole with options and things to mess around with, make me want to commit to reach a high Lv AND make me want to make more characters, basically rewarding me for spending time in the game.</p>
